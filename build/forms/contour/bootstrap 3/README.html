<h1>PLEASE NOTE</h1>

<p>This folder contains entire Umbraco Contour &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; folders.</p>

<p>Umbraco contour&rsquo;s form markup is configured by editing a number of files in the base umbraco/plugin/umbracoContour folder
these files are as follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>/Views/form.cshtml: The base form constructor - if you want to edit the type of form (form-inline/form-horizontal) used by ALL FORMS in this site, then here you are.</li>
<li>/Views/FieldType.xxx: should be fairly self-explanatory - this is the code which renders each individual field type.</li>
</ul>


<p>Obviously there&rsquo;s more than this - as you find out, add the information here!</p>
